Array
how are we going to organize data? = data structure
most basic data structure = array

world without arrays
const mon = "mon";
const tue = "tue";
const wed = "wed";
const thu = "thu";
const fri = "fri";
const sat = "sat";
const sun = "sun";
it will be tidious to make variables for every datas that are needed for the same reason, ex) shopping list, types of stuff
making a list is better than writing every independent variables

making array
const array = ["",""];
any data type can be stored in array
number, "text", boolean, variable

finding item in array
array[0], array[4]
computer doesn't count from 1, it counts from 0
so the array starts index number from 0 not 1

changing existing array
array.push("");



Object
how can we store items with more details? = object & properties
it is not a list, list can only store data needed for same reason, they all have the exact detail, useless when a different detail data is stored because we can't know it has a different detail

making object
const player = {
	name: "Vambroag",
	points: 10,
	fat: false,
};
any data type can be come a property inside object

we can't change the object directly, but we can change properties inside the object
X player = person;
O player.person = true;
O player.points = player.points + 15;
O player.fat = true;


Functions
function is a piece of code we can run over and over and over and over forever
it helps to reduce our code that repeats or uses the same format

-making function
function sayHello() {
	console.log("Hello!");
}

-using function
sayHello();
writing the name of the function will execute(run) the function

function can also receive data from the outside, we can send data to function
this argument can be only used inside the function
function greet(personName) {
	console.log("Hello " + personName + "! Nice to meet you!");
}
greet("Vambroag"); // result: Hello Vambroag! Nice to meet you!

if there is only one argument then the function will only take the first data it receives even though there is alot of data being sent
greet("Vambroag", "Nico", "Dal", "Nicolas");
// result: Hello Vambroag! Nice to meet you!

there can be multiple argument
function introduceMyself(myName, myAge, myHeight) {
	console.log("Hello! I'm " + myName + ". I'm " + myAge + " and " + myHeight + "cm tall.");
}
function introduceMyself(Vamrboag, 23, 179);
// result: Hello! I'm Vambroag. I'm 23 and 179cm tall.

argument is sent to function in written order
function introduceMyself(Vamrboag, 23, 179);
// result: Hello! I'm Vambroag. I'm 23 and 179cm tall.
function introduceMyself(23, 179, Vambroag);
// result: Hello! I'm 23. I'm 179 and Vambroagcm tall.

function can be made inside object
const player = {
	name: "Vambroag",
	sayHello: function (otherPersonName) {
		console.log("Hello " + otherPersonName + " nice to meet you!");
	},
};
console.log(player.name); // result: Vambroag
player.sayHello("Nico"); // result: Hello Nico nice to meet you!
